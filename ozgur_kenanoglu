Provided video remarks advanced data analytics and its correlation between work of Epidemiologists. *italic* The profession of Epidemiologists are people  who focus on issues relation to disease outbreaks in order to avoid them. *italic* Zhian Kamvar has been able to hold a hacktahon with a focus on utilizing R with epidemilogists ambitions to overcome problems. Their biggest challenge was not having access to data, but they had been able to use random stimulated data from R dictionary. I believe this is the beauty of R world, one can simulate a world by simply using a random data set!

Before hackathon they had an agenda of lower burden on epidemiologists with a motto of Doctors without borders.In order to do so, they have chosen significant reports which includes surveys and outbreak reports (ie: cholera, meningitis...etc.)

After sorting out the relevant data they tried to ease their work but there was not capable packages on R, therefore they have utilized RMarkdown.
